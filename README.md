## Scenarios

One familiar action covers sign-in, approvals and channel linking. Each scenario points at a
runnable sample in this repository, or — where the scenario is the same authorize request with
different parameters — at its HTTP-level recipe in the documentation.

- **Fast sign-in and registration.** Passwordless sign-in for web and desktop apps: a QR on
  screen, confirmation in a messenger. Registration happens with the same action — no form,
  no password. Samples: [`samples/dotnet/inproc/login`](./samples/dotnet/inproc/login/) (Veriqa
  inside your host) and
  [`samples/dotnet/inproc/login-client`](./samples/dotnet/inproc/login-client/) (a relying party
  that only knows OIDC); other stacks — the
  [quickstarts](https://veriqa.app/docs) for Node, Java and Python.
- **Replacing SMS codes.** The same familiar flow, but with no per-message charge — and with
  full authentication instead of code delivery. Recipe:
  [Replacing SMS codes](https://veriqa.app/docs/scenarios/sms-replacement).
- **AI agents and human-in-the-loop.** A tool call or an access grant for an AI agent is
  confirmed in the user's own messenger — a surface the agent does not control, and with an
  audit record. Samples:
  [`samples/dotnet/inproc/agent-approval`](./samples/dotnet/inproc/agent-approval/) and a
  ready plugin for Claude Code, [`samples/claude-code`](./samples/claude-code/).
- **Second factor, step-up and action approvals.** Sensitive actions — deleting important
  data, changing payment details, granting someone else access — are confirmed with a single
  tap in the user's messenger. Sample:
  [`samples/dotnet/inproc/step-up`](./samples/dotnet/inproc/step-up/), which also checks that
  the person who confirmed is the account owner.
- **Sign-in on surfaces with no keyboard.** A smart TV, a set-top box, a kiosk, a device where
  typing a password or a mailbox is punishment: the screen shows the QR and waits for the
  outcome, and the user types nothing at all. Where the surface has a browser or a webview the
  flow is the ordinary one and only the way it learns the outcome differs — live status or
  polling `GET /api/transaction/{id}/status`. Where it has none, the application's backend
  creates a confirmation and exchanges the confirmed transaction for the user's `id_token` —
  sample: [`samples/dotnet/inproc/confirmation`](./samples/dotnet/inproc/confirmation/), the
  surface-by-surface table is in
  [Sign-in surfaces](https://veriqa.app/docs/scenarios/surfaces). A device with neither a
  browser nor a backend of its own has no path yet — device flow is in progress.
- **Sign-in + messenger channel linking in one action.** The user is signed in, and your
  product gets a live channel for notifications and service scenarios. Recipe:
  [Sign-in and channel linking](https://veriqa.app/docs/scenarios/channel-linking).
- **Leads and feedback without CAPTCHA.** A visitor verifies themselves via a messenger in a
  few seconds — the site gets a verified contact instead of a "dead" address from a form.
  Recipe: [Leads and feedback without CAPTCHA](https://veriqa.app/docs/scenarios/lead-capture).
- **Starting from zero — [Get started](https://veriqa.app/docs).** Quickstarts for .NET, Node,
  Java and Python, plus the self-hosted and OS-service paths: from an empty project to a
  working sign-in, with the configuration keys spelled out.

### Approvals in Claude Code

A ready [Claude Code plugin](./samples/claude-code/) stops chosen agent actions until a person
approves them in a messenger — and every approval, refusal and expiry lands in the audit trail.

## What your product gets

- **Higher sign-in conversion.** Every extra step loses people: on average 70% of online
  shopping carts are abandoned, and among shoppers who leave checkout 18% go because the site
  demanded an account and 17% because it took too long.[^baymard] 42% of people abandoned a
  purchase in the past month because they could not remember a password.[^fido-barometer]
  Instead of a password, an SMS code and screen hops — one familiar action: opening the camera
  on the phone. Sign-in or registration takes about 6 seconds in the target scenario.
- **Savings on every sign-in.** SMS is billed per message and gets more expensive year over
  year. Sign-in and approval via Veriqa aren't billed per message — at sign-in scale this shows
  up in the budget.
- **A live channel instead of a "dead" address.** Along with the sign-in, your product gets a
  connected messenger channel — for notifications, approvals and future service scenarios.
- **Configuration-only integration.** No install for the user and no new client-side code —
  Veriqa plugs into your running app through configuration.
- **Account recovery.** "Forgot password" is no longer a quest: a linked trusted channel
  becomes a reliable recovery path, without a chain of e-mails and codes.
- **Resilience to a personal-data leak.** A messenger connector usually stores the link between
  a person and the way to reach them — the most toxic column a breach can carry. Veriqa keeps
  that link out of the database entirely: a derived value instead of the native identifier, a
  different one for every integrator. Two leaked databases do not join up.

## Why not a password, SMS or passkeys

First, a comparison by what matters to the user and to the business: how many steps the first
visit takes, how long a repeat sign-in takes, and whether you are left with a way to reach the
person.

| Method | First visit | Repeat sign-in | Contact channel |
|---|---|---|---|
| Password | Form, password, confirmation e-mail | ~69 s with a second factor | E-mail, if confirmed |
| SMS code | Phone number, wait for the SMS, type the code | ~31 s\* | Phone — every message is billed |
| Social login | Button, consent screen, often a profile to complete | ~31 s\* | Usually e-mail |
| Passkey | An account by some other method first, then create the key | 3–8.5 s if the key already exists on this device; phone → PC needs Bluetooth | None |
| Veriqa | Point the camera and tap "Confirm" — the same action as at sign-in | Under 3 s | The messenger is already connected |

\* 31.2 s is the combined average for e-mail, SMS and social login, not a separate measurement
of each method.

Sign-in times: FIDO Alliance Passkey Index — 8.5 s for passkeys and 31.2 s on average for
e-mail, SMS and social login;[^passkey-index] Microsoft — 3 s for synced passkeys against 69 s
for a password with a second factor.[^microsoft] These are repeat sign-in times, when the
account and the key already exist: registration and passkey creation are not included. Veriqa —
our own measurement in the target scenario.

Compared with messenger login widgets: one integration layer for all channels and e-mail
instead of separate widgets, and full OIDC instead of a JS widget — tokens, sessions, account
linking, second factor and an audit trail.

## Under the hood

- **A sign-in is a transaction** with an explicit state, a lifetime and a single outcome. It
  survives a change of device, expires on its own, is idempotent to repeats and lands in the
  audit trail.
- **Confirmations without a sign-in.** Your backend can ask a person to approve an action — a
  payment, a device, a data transfer — straight from server to server: it creates the
  transaction, shows the QR, reads the outcome, and can check that it was the account owner who
  confirmed. The contract is the
  [server-to-server confirmation API](https://veriqa.app/docs/reference/confirmation-api).
- **Channel adapters** — Telegram, WhatsApp, other channels and Email — are switched on by
  configuration; the full list is in [Channels](https://veriqa.app/channels). A channel of your
  own needs no change to the core and does not have to be .NET: an external service in any
  language over HTTP, or the bot you already run.
- **Any stack, standard OIDC.** On .NET — a connector on top of OpenIddict, embedded in your
  host. Everywhere else — a standalone OIDC provider: Node, Java, Python, Go, PHP. In an IAM
  such as Logto it is added as an ordinary social connector.
- **All of it is configuration** — tokens, channels, the texts and branding of the sign-in
  page, policies, limits, the audit trail — with several levels of ownership and a defined
  resolution order. One installation serves many projects and bots, each with its own.
- **The audit trail follows your rules** and can be switched off entirely. Identities are
  masked and tokens are written neither to the log nor to the audit — that is how it is built,
  not a setting you have to remember. Metrics, logs and traces come the same way.
- **.NET 10, shipped as NuGet packages**, as a Docker image and as self-contained archives for
  Linux and Windows. Storage in memory, EF Core (PostgreSQL, SQL Server) or Redis. The sign-in
  page is plain JS — no frameworks, no external dependencies. The data does not leave your
  perimeter.

## Three ways to deploy

**Embedded (NuGet).** Veriqa runs inside your ASP.NET Core host as an OpenIddict connector: the
OIDC endpoints, the sign-in page, the transaction engine and the channel adapters are all in
your process. No separate service to operate.

**Standalone (Docker).** Veriqa runs as its own OIDC auth server in a container. Your
application — on any stack — talks to it over standard OpenID Connect and does not reference a
single Veriqa package: nothing enters your build or your SBOM. Sign-in through Veriqa has been
run on WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, TYPO3 and Bitrix this way, with no changes to the CMS core.

**OS service (archive).** The same standalone auth server without a container: a self-contained
executable and an installer that registers it as a systemd unit on Linux or a Windows service.
The machine needs neither Docker nor a .NET runtime.

All three are available today — see [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md).

## Channels

| Channel | Status |
|---|---|
| Telegram | supported |
| WhatsApp (Meta Cloud API) | supported |
| MAX | supported |
| Email (magic link and the one-tap email) | supported |
| Viber | in testing — ships in the next release |
| LINE | in testing — ships in the next release |
| Messenger | in testing — ships in the next release |
| Instagram Direct | in testing — ships in the next release |
| Slack | in testing — ships in the next release |

Four channels ship today, and five more are already in testing for the next release — 8+ channels. What else
the next release brings: [Next release](https://veriqa.app/docs/next-release).

Email works two ways. The classic **magic link** is on by default; the **one-tap email** turns the
letter around — the user sends a pre-filled one instead of receiving it, so the sign-in no longer
depends on your mail reaching their inbox, and there is no one-time link for a corporate mail
gateway to spend before the person clicks it. What each mode costs and buys:
[choosing between them](https://veriqa.app/docs/guides/channels#which-mode-to-choose).

Custom channels plug in through the MIT-licensed `Veriqa.Core.Contracts` package or as an
external service over HTTP — see `samples/dotnet/custom-channel/` and the
[channels list](https://veriqa.app/channels).

## FAQ

**Does the user need to install a separate app?**
No. The user confirms sign-in in a messenger they already have — Telegram or WhatsApp; no
separate authenticator to install.

**What if the user doesn't have Telegram or WhatsApp?**
There are several channels, plus e-mail — the user picks the one they have. The list of
supported messengers keeps growing.

**Does Veriqa replace our auth system?**
No. Veriqa stands next to it: your auth system keeps issuing tokens and owning accounts, and
Veriqa adds the trusted channel the user confirms in. For an application Veriqa is a standard
OpenID Connect provider, so the stack does not matter.

**Does Veriqa replace OpenIddict?**
No — and this question only concerns .NET. There Veriqa is a connector on top of OpenIddict,
which stays the foundation of authentication. On any other stack OpenIddict is not involved at
all: the application talks to Veriqa over plain OpenID Connect.

**How does it differ from passkeys, and is it safer?**
Passkeys are phishing-resistant by design — a higher security bar. Veriqa offers the same
convenient flow for simpler scenarios and works where cross-device passkeys break: Bluetooth
off, a VM, remote desktop.

**How much does a sign-in cost compared with an SMS code?**
Sign-in and approval via Veriqa aren't billed per message, unlike SMS — at noticeable sign-in
volume this is direct savings.
