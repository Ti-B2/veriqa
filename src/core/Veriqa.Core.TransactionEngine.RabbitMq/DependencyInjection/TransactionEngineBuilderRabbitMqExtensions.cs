    /// The transport is additive: in-process dispatch to the registered

    /// sign-in push and the prompt cleanup keep receiving events. Reliability of what leaves the
    /// process is the reliability of the broker and of nothing else — the engine builds no
    /// guarantee of its own on top of the transport.
    /// <para>
    /// Supported extension point (B14.2): the implementation is complete, but no host in this
    /// repository wires it, so its behaviour against a live broker is not tracked by CI — validate
    /// the connection in the consuming host when you enable it. What CI does cover is the
    /// composition: the in-process subscribers keep their events with this transport in place.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// A host writing a transport of its own can copy the shape below, and then owes what the shape
    /// implies: one object standing under several registrations (the concrete type, the publisher
    /// interface, the hosted service) is released once per registration on shutdown, so its
    /// <c>Dispose</c>/<c>DisposeAsync</c> has to do nothing on the calls after the first — the
    /// contract of <see cref="IDisposable"/>, and what the publisher here does with a flag of its
    /// own. That is a property of the registrations, not of the engine: the engine folds the
    /// interface registration into the fan-out without adding or removing a release.
