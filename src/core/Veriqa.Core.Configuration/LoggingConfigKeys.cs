/// The home of these two keys is the mechanism assembly, and that is a deliberate exception rather
/// than a new norm: this assembly is otherwise a mechanism without product keys. It is the only
/// place both sides of the axis already depend on — the auth server, which owns the section their
/// core level is read from, and the audit trail, which is the consumer of the resolved values.
/// Putting them in either of those two would make one a dependency of the other, which is exactly
/// backwards for a journal: an audit sink is cross-cutting, not a feature of an OIDC server.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Declaring a key and owning its home are different acts (CFG-203). These keys are declared into
/// the schema of a deployment by ANY owner that registers the catalogs — the call that registers a
/// catalog brings this axis with it, so the auth server and the contour of the channels alike carry
/// it — and not by the audit trail: the journal is opt-in, and if it carried the declaration, a key that
/// is read with or without it would disappear from the schema of a deployment that never wired the
/// journal. The price of that arrangement is stated here once, because everything the two keys below
/// promise rests on it: a host that composes the journal onto the transaction engine ALONE registers
/// no catalog of this axis, so its keys are outside that host's schema — no level defines them, the
/// resolution answers with the default of the type, and the strict domains below have nothing to hold
