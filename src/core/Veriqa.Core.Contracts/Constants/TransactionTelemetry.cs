/// The two groups of tag names below are not separated cosmetically. A name from
/// <see cref="TransactionTypeTag"/>/<see cref="OutcomeTag"/> is admissible both on a metric and on a
/// span; a name from <see cref="TransactionIdTag"/>/<see cref="CorrelationTraceIdTag"/> is
/// admissible on a span only. A metric tag is a dimension: every distinct value is a new time
/// series, and a per-operation identifier there would grow the series count without bound.
/// The channel tag is deliberately NOT redeclared here: <c>ChannelTelemetry.ChannelTypeTag</c>
/// already carries <c>channel_type</c> and is in use — one fact, one home.
