# Veriqa.Core.ChannelAdapter

The channel contour of Veriqa: the registration SPI every channel plugs into, the webhook pipeline
and the settings resolution seam. The channels themselves — the ones shipped with the product and a
third-party one alike — live in their own packages and bring their own platform SDK, so this package
depends on no channel platform at all.

## Packages

Two ways to install the channels, and both are ordinary NuGet:

```bash
# the base set in one package: Telegram, WhatsApp, Email (plus this contour)
dotnet add package Veriqa.Core.BaseChannels
# MAX is deliberately outside the metapackage — install it explicitly when you need it
dotnet add package Veriqa.Core.ChannelAdapter.Max

# or take only the channel you actually use — nothing else arrives with it
dotnet add package Veriqa.Core.ChannelAdapter.Email
```

| Package | Contents | Platform dependency |
|---|---|---|
| `Veriqa.Core.ChannelAdapter` | the contour: `AddChannel`, the webhook pipeline, channel settings | none |
| `Veriqa.Core.ChannelAdapter.Telegram` | the Telegram channel | `Telegram.Bot` |
| `Veriqa.Core.ChannelAdapter.WhatsApp` | the WhatsApp channel (Meta Cloud API) | none — plain HTTP |
| `Veriqa.Core.ChannelAdapter.Max` | the MAX channel | `Max.BotClient` |
| `Veriqa.Core.ChannelAdapter.Email` | the Email channel | `MailKit`, `QRCoder` |
| `Veriqa.Core.ChannelAdapter.Redis` | Redis-backed channel stores (multiple replicas) | `StackExchange.Redis` |
| `Veriqa.Core.BaseChannels` | metapackage: the contour + Telegram, WhatsApp, Email | — |

`Veriqa.Core.AuthServer` depends on the contour only, so no channel library reaches a host through
it: a deployment that signs users in through Telegram alone never receives a mail library.
Installing both the metapackage and a separate channel is fine — NuGet resolves it to one copy.

## Registration

The registration call does not change with the package it arrives from: every `Add*` is an
extension method in this assembly's own namespace.

Register the adapters through the AuthServer facade:

```csharp
authServer.AddChannelAdapters(adapters =>
{
    adapters.AddTelegram();  // Telegram channel
    adapters.AddWhatsApp();  // WhatsApp channel
    adapters.AddMax();       // MAX channel
    adapters.AddEmail();     // Email channel (magic-link)
});
```

## Replacing a shipped implementation

The shipped implementations of the public channel ports — `IEmailActionTokenStore`,
`IEmailOutboundSender`, `IWhatsAppProvider` — are registered with `TryAddSingleton`, so **your
registration always wins over the built-in default and the result does not depend on call
order**:

```csharp
// 1. A plain registration made before AddVeriqaChannelAdapters (directly or through
//    AddVeriqaAuthServer, which calls it): yours is already in the collection, so the
//    shipped default is not added at all.
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IEmailActionTokenStore, MyActionTokenStore>();
builder.Services.AddVeriqaAuthServer(configuration, environment, authServer =>
    authServer.AddChannelAdapters(adapters => adapters.AddEmail()));

// 2. RemoveAll + Add after AddVeriqa* — still supported, unchanged.
builder.Services.RemoveAll<IEmailActionTokenStore>();
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IEmailActionTokenStore, MyActionTokenStore>();
```

This is the same discipline the AuthServer extension points follow — see
`Veriqa.Core.AuthServer/README.md`, "Substitution does not depend on call order".

> A port consumed as `IEnumerable<T>` is not covered by this: `IChannelAdapter` collects every
> registration rather than picks one, so a host adds to it with a plain registration and
> replaces nothing.

> Neither is an explicitly requested implementation: `UseRedisChannelStores` (see
> "Multiple replicas") registers its three stores unconditionally, precisely so that it beats the
> `TryAdd`-ed defaults in either call order. A host that wants its own store of one of those ports
> while using the satellite replaces it with `RemoveAll` + `Add` after the call.

## Multiple replicas

The contour keeps three stores of its own, and their shipped implementations are in-process:
`IChannelPromptMessageStore` (coordinates of the in-channel prompt already sent),
`IEmailActionTokenStore` and `IEmailPushCorrelationStore` (the Email channel's Pull tokens, Push
correlations and inbound-mail deduplication). One replica is fine. Two are not: a magic link opened
on replica B finds no token minted on replica A, an inbound email is not matched to its
transaction, and a prompt is not edited on expiry when the event lands on the other instance.

Deploying more than one replica — install the Redis satellite and wire all three ports with one
call:

```bash
dotnet add package Veriqa.Core.ChannelAdapter.Redis
```

```csharp
authServer.AddChannelAdapters(adapters =>
{
    adapters.AddEmail();

    adapters.UseRedisChannelStores(redis =>
    {
        // Leave empty to reuse an IConnectionMultiplexer already registered in the container.
        redis.Configuration = "localhost:6379";
    });
});
```

Unlike the shipped defaults, these three registrations are unconditional, so the result does not
depend on whether the call comes before or after `AddEmail()`. Without the call nothing changes —
the in-process defaults stay. Setting `Configuration` while another component registers a non-keyed
`IConnectionMultiplexer` stops the host at start-up with an error naming both connections by their
endpoints, logical database, TLS settings and sentinel master name (credentials are never printed),
rather than quietly sending the channel stores to the other Redis. The check runs when the host
starts, so it holds whichever of the two registrations came first.

Key prefixes and the deduplication window are `RedisChannelStoreOptions`; record lifetimes are not,
because they belong to the stored entity — a token and a correlation live until their own
`ExpiresAt`, prompt coordinates until the longest transaction the engine can create has expired and
the expiry event that consumes them has had time to be published.

## Supported channels

| Channel | Delivery | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Telegram | Bot API (webhook or long polling) | Full support. |
| MAX | Bot API (webhook or long polling) | Full support. |
| WhatsApp | Meta Cloud API | The shipped provider; a custom one can be registered. |
| Email | SMTP or a custom sender (via DI) | Magic-link delivery, not a pushed prompt. |

A third-party channel is registered exactly the same way — through `AddChannel` on the same builder;
see the [custom channel adapter guide](https://veriqa.app/docs/guides/custom-channel-adapter). Nothing in this package treats a shipped channel
differently from one you wrote.

## WhatsApp: the shipped provider and a custom one

WhatsApp delivery ships with the **Meta Cloud API** provider, and it is the only one in the box.
A host plugs its own delivery provider with `UseWhatsAppProvider<TProvider>()` on the channel adapter
builder — before or after `AddWhatsApp()`, the last call wins. A provider names itself with a code
(`WhatsAppProviderNames` holds the shipped ones), and `Veriqa:Channels:WhatsApp:Provider` declares the
code the installation expects. The two are compared at startup: a mismatch stops the host with an
error naming both codes, so the declared and the actual delivery path never diverge silently.

Webhook signature validation stays specific to the Meta Cloud API — a custom provider gets working
delivery and a webhook that the adapter rejects.

## Email

The email channel delivers a magic-link email rather than a pushed confirmation prompt, so the
generic push/webhook adapter methods do not apply to it. Its inbound and outbound flows use the
dedicated email endpoints and the SMTP or custom outbound sender. Currently supported outbound
providers are `Smtp` and `Custom` (registered via DI).
