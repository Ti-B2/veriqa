# Veriqa.Core.TransactionEngine.Migrations.SqlServer

SQL Server migrations for the transaction schema of the Veriqa Transaction Engine. The package
contains no API of its own: it is the migrations assembly a host names by string when it configures
the EF Core store, plus the design-time factory `dotnet ef` needs.

A host that takes the core from NuGet cannot create the schema on SQL Server without it — the
migrations its EF Core options name by assembly name live here. Migrations are per provider by EF
Core design, so a different database gets a different package, not a switch inside this one.

## Install

```bash
dotnet add package Veriqa.Core.TransactionEngine.Migrations.SqlServer
```

## Wiring

```csharp
authServer.ConfigureTransactionEngine(te =>
    te.UseEfCoreStore(ef => ef.UseSqlServer(
        connectionString,
        sqlServer => sqlServer.MigrationsAssembly("Veriqa.Core.TransactionEngine.Migrations.SqlServer"))));
```
