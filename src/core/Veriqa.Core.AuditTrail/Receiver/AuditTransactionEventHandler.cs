/// <remarks>
/// The decision is taken per event, at handling time: no per-transaction snapshot of the mode is
/// kept, and records missed in another mode are never reconstructed. A transaction that outlives a
/// mode switch therefore leaves a partial trail — that is the expected behaviour, not a defect.
/// Audit is off the critical path of a transaction: a failing sink or resolver is logged and
/// swallowed, never propagated back into the sign-in flow. Handling is also kept short with the
/// audit off, because the same dispatcher runs the real-time sign-in handlers after this one.
