/// The sequence touches no channel: it drives the transaction state machine and the identity
/// resolution, both of which belong to the engine, so it lives with them rather than in the channel
/// assembly its callers happen to come from. That keeps every path that finalizes a sign-in — the
/// webhook path (auto-confirmation and the in-channel button) and the core confirmation page, which
/// answers for a transaction whose channel data arrived earlier — on one implementation, and lets a
/// future path reach it without depending on the channel assembly. A second copy of this sequence
/// would be a second place to keep the compensation correct. Static with explicit dependencies: the
/// webhook path is itself static and already carries the services (its public entry points take them
/// as parameters), so a DI service would have to be threaded through signatures that must not change.
