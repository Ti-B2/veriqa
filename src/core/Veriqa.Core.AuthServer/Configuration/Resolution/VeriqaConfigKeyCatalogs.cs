/// are three different acts (CFG-203). The home of that axis is the mechanism assembly because its
/// two readers — the channel contour and the audit trail — depend on neither one another, and this
/// composition registers it because the contour that reads it registers nothing for it. A host that
/// composes the channels WITHOUT this server names that catalog at its own composition root instead:
/// the contour refuses to start a deployment that enabled a channel and declared no value, so an
/// undeclared key is not the harmless absence it is for the keys of any other owner such a host did
/// not compose.
