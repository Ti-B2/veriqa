/// Validator for the OIDC client options. Verifies the configuration of each client every time the
/// options are created — at startup through ValidateOnStart, and again after every reload of a
/// watched configuration source.
/// <para>
/// The unit of MOST rules is a SINGLE client entry (<see cref="OidcClientValidationRules"/>), not the
/// whole array. At startup that distinction is invisible: any broken entry fails validation and stops
/// the process, which is the correct outcome for a deployment error. On a reload the broken entries
/// have already been dropped by <see cref="OidcClientsOptionsPostConfigure"/>, so what reaches this
/// validator is the surviving set and the neighbours keep working.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Uniqueness of <see cref="OidcClientOptions.ClientId"/> is the one rule of the SET (SPEC-012
/// CFG-155). It cannot be a per-entry rule: both duplicates are valid on their own, so the
/// reload-time dropper has nothing to remove and picking a winner would be the very shadowing the
/// rule prevents. A reload that introduces a duplicate therefore fails as a whole, and the accessor
/// keeps serving the last valid snapshot instead of disabling the client.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A reload that still fails here does not stop the process, and no read of the options is left
/// holding the failure. <see cref="IOptionsMonitor{TOptions}.CurrentValue"/> throws on every read
/// until the configuration is fixed: the reads of the sign-in path go through
/// <see cref="OidcClientsOptionsAccessor"/>, which serves the last valid snapshot, and a read taken
/// straight from the monitor happens inside the guard the resolver puts around one level of one key
/// (SPEC-012 CFG-233), which degrades that level instead of failing the resolution.
/// <see cref="IOptions{TOptions}.Value"/> survives such a reload on its own because it caches the
/// instance created on its first read, and that read happens at startup: the client seeder is a
/// hosted service taking it in the constructor.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The monitor also reads the options ITSELF on the announcement path — it re-creates the instance
/// before notifying its change subscribers — and that read is behind neither guard, so this is where
/// the failure of such a reload actually surfaces: the change notification is not delivered and the
/// subscribers do not run for it, while the process keeps going. That costs nothing here, because a
/// reload that does not validate changes no effective value — every consumer keeps the snapshot it
/// already had — and the next reload that does validate announces itself normally.
