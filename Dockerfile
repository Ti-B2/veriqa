# Veriqa Core Auth Server — multi-stage Dockerfile
# Target platforms: linux/amd64 (default) and linux/arm64
# Usage: docker build -t veriqa-authserver .
#        docker run -p 8080:8080 veriqa-authserver

# ── Stage 1: Restore inputs ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The restore layer needs every MSBuild input of the host graph: the project file of each
# transitively referenced project plus the build-wide props/targets. Enumerating them by hand
# rotted repeatedly — a project was added and this list was not updated — so the set is derived
# from the build context instead: copy it whole, then keep only the restore inputs. The build
# stage below copies just that pruned tree, so its restore layer is reused as long as no project
# or props/targets file changes: editing sources does not invalidate it.

# SNI) into a Linux image. The RID is written to a file so restore and publish use the same value.

# PathMap rewrites the build context root (/src/) to /_/ in every compiled path the image carries:
# the file:line frames of stack traces, embedded and portable PDBs, CallerFilePath. Without it an
# operator reading the container log sees the absolute source layout of the build machine. The
# mapping is spelled out rather than obtained through ContinuousIntegrationBuild: that switch derives
# PathMap from the git SourceRoot, and .dockerignore keeps .git out of this context, so there is no
# repository to locate and the deterministic-path targets fail with "SourceRoot items must include at
# least one top-level item". /_/ is the same prefix a git-based deterministic build produces. The
# value must contain no comma: on the command line a comma separates properties.
