# Custom channel adapter sample (.NET)

A third-party channel plugged into embedded Veriqa through the public SPI — no core fork.

| Project | What it is | Veriqa dependencies |
|---|---|---|
| `adapter/` | The channel adapter itself: `IChannelAdapter` + optional `IChannelDisplayMetadata` | `Veriqa.Core.Contracts` (MIT) only |
| `host/` | Reference wiring: registration, webhook route, sign-in button | the full embedded set, including the MPL-2.0 `Veriqa.Core.ChannelAdapter` |

The split is the point: an adapter builds against the MIT contracts package alone. Only the host —
the application that embeds the server — needs the server core.

## Run it

```bash
cd samples/dotnet/custom-channel/host
AcmeChat__WebhookSecret=dev-secret dotnet run
```

The secret is read from configuration; keep it in `dotnet user-secrets` or an environment variable,
never in `appsettings.json`.

Open the sign-in window:

```
https://localhost:7320/connect/authorize?client_id=my-app&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A7320%2Fsignin-oidc&response_type=code&scope=openid%20profile&state=st1&code_challenge=E9Melhoa2OwvFrEMTJguCHaoeK1t8URWbuGJSstw-cM&code_challenge_method=S256
```

The window shows an **Acme Chat** button whose deep link carries the transaction id
(`?tx=…`). The real platform would open its app there; the sample simulates the platform by
posting the webhook by hand:

```bash
curl -k -X POST https://localhost:7320/api/channels/acme-chat/webhook \
  -H "X-Acme-Signature: dev-secret" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"transaction_id":"<tx from the deep link>","user_id":"u-42","display_name":"Alice Acme"}'
```

The transaction moves to confirmed and then completed, and the browser finishes the OIDC flow.

## What the SPI guarantees

- `POST /api/channels/{channelType}/webhook` (plus the tenant-segment variant) is mapped for the
  channel with the same rate-limit policy and the same 1 MB body limit as the built-in channels.
- `ValidateWebhookAsync` runs before the adapter's processing — but after the tenant demultiplexer,
  which answers 403 on an unknown tenant segment without calling the adapter, and after the single
  read of the body into the envelope.
  A rejection — and an exception thrown by the validation itself — answers 403.
- After a successful validation the answer is always 200, even if the adapter fails or throws. A
  body over the limit is answered 200 as well: reading it is Veriqa's job and its failure is not a
  validation verdict.
- Both `ValidateWebhookAsync` and `ProcessInboundEventAsync` receive the same
  `ChannelInboundRequest` envelope: the HTTP method, the **raw body bytes** (a signature is computed
  over exactly those, so nothing in between can swallow a byte-order mark), the headers and the
  query parameters (names compared case-insensitively, repeated values joined with `", "`).
  Decoding and parsing the body are the adapter's job — the core imposes no body format.
- The channel type must match `\A[a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,63}\z`; a violation, a duplicate, a collision with
  a built-in channel or a mismatch with the adapter's own `ChannelType` fails the startup with an
  explicit message.
- The registration ↔ adapter cross-check runs on host start, so it also covers a channel registered
  with `mapWebhook: false`. It is exact for native adapters and per-adapter class proxies, and
  best-effort under a sweeping decorator over every `IChannelAdapter` (Scrutor `Decorate`, a Castle
  interface proxy on the whole set), which hides the adapters' runtime types.
- Display metadata is degraded, never trusted: a blank `DisplayName` — or one over 32 characters —
  falls back to the channel type, and glyph markup outside the allowed shape elements (or over 4096
  characters) is dropped (the channel renders without an icon).

Known limitation of this SPI version: the generic route accepts **POST only** — a GET verification
handshake (the WhatsApp Hub Challenge analogue) is not supported.
